# Etch-A-Sketch

A project I created for the Odin Project. The goal was to make a drawing web application. I tried to recreate the MS Paint 95 look.

## Version 1.0

**Features:**
- Draw tool
- Random color tool
- Erase tool
- Recolor tool
- Color selection
- Background color selection
- Grid toggle option
- Clear canvas option
- Pen size slider

**Features to be added in the future:**
- Responsive design

**Code comment**
I learned that global variables should be avoided in JavaScript. If I get back to this project in the future, I might do some refactoring to improve that.
